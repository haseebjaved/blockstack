Mostly questions around mining, from pages 9 & 10 in the Token whitepaper (haven't read beyond page 10 yet):

1. How does the burning of a layer 1 token prove the security and credibility of the layer 2 blockchain? There is no difficult hash to solve it appears. What are the miners solving or doing besides burning the layer 1 token to deserve the mining rewards?

2. Is a block added to the blockchain after a pre-determined period of time regardless of the number or mine transactions recorded within? Or is a block only added after a minimum number of mine transactions have been recorded within? 

3. Are the 8000 tokens released per block (in the first year) reserved only for proof of burn miners or will some of the 8000 tokens be rewarded to users and app developers as well?

4. Are all proof of burn tokens released in a given block rewarded to one miner based on them burning the most layer 1 tokens? Or are they split based on the proportion of layer 1 tokens burned by multiple miners? 

5. Based on the 4.7 billion tokens created after 10 years, roughly 3 billion will be mined over 10 years. The remaining 1.7 billion will be released in the genesis block, correct? Are some/all of these 1.7 billion up for investors to purchase during the token sale?

6. "...the mining reward for the current block is divided proportionally based on the fraction of the total amount burned (of the last N blocks)." This implies that the amount of layer 1 tokens burned (and hence the dollar value destroyed) is not constant per block and can fluctuate per block, correct? Why so, and why are the # of layer 2 tokens released kept constant?

7. Is mining reward for a given block divided proportionally because the number of mine operations per block can vary, and hence the amount of layer 1 tokens burnt will vary per block? And/or is it because the type of mine operations carry different burn weight, for instance a create record is more expensive than an update record? Hence the amount of layer 1 tokens burnt will be different per block due to the random nature of mine operations and their unique burn weights?

8. This would imply that since the # of layer 2 tokens rewarded per block is constant, and assuming the # of mining operations (and the underlying layer 1 tokens burnt) varies per block, some blocks will be more and some less profitable for the miner. Correct?

9. Why does a mine operation in a given block receive only a small reward from it's own block, and the remaining rewards from the next N - 1 blocks? Why not receive all of its reward from the current block or all from the next N - 1 blocks? 

10. Last question, why are rewards being handed out at the mine operation level, and not at the block level?
